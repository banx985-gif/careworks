// and the home world (src/systems/homeWorld.js) runs them.
//
// The rules this data serves:
//   - Natural decline is never a failure. Nothing here takes a score, Credits or Rank away; a well-supported end of
//     life can only lift Clinical Safety, Resident Wellbeing and Family Trust (SIGNAL).
//   - End of life is forecast through slow, clear care-stage changes (STAGES), never sudden: each stage lasts at least
//     its `days[0]`, the stages never skip, and nothing the player does wrong can hurry one (PACE: care can only slow).
//   - Gentle words only: no illness names, no medicines, no clinical detail (data/clinical.js NEVER_SAY is checked by
//     the M27 test on every string here), no sad stings, no "game over".
