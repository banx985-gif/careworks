// Funding and the economy (Milestone 22, bible §27, §0.1 / §2.5 unsafe care is never a profit strategy, §14 under-
// staffing never saves money, §17 a ready rehab resident earns nothing). Plain data only; the rules are in
// src/systems/economy.js, src/systems/ledger.js (the month's close) and the home world. Numbers tuned in M22 by seeded
// runs (docs/DECISIONS.md has the tables); change them here.
//
// The design rule: Care Support Funding pays for the care a level needs. For each Support Level,
//   funding − required care cost ≈ the same small margin (slightly smaller at higher levels),
// where required care cost = the staff time the level needs (its care minutes a day × 28 × MINUTE_COST) + supplies +
// equipment wear. So higher acuity never beats lower acuity once the required staff are paid;
// the accommodation fee (by room) is what keeps a well-run home in a modest profit.

// --- Support Levels 1–5 (from needs) ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// A resident's Support Level comes from their assessed needs (at admission): a care load = the six needs added up, the
// Clinical/Nursing need counting 1.5×; then these thresholds (care load at or above → that level). Every §7 profile lands
// on the level its support type always had (Light 1 · Social / Nutrition 2 · Mobility / Rehab 3 · Memory / Clinical 4 ·
// High Care 5); a rolled applicant may land one either side.

};
// Staff time from the task model: the care minutes a resident at each level takes a day (measured in M22: 4 residents of
// each support type, safely staffed, a week — 133 / 134 / 209 / ~150 / 231 — smoothed so it never falls as the level
// rises), and what a hands-on minute costs (a Standard carer's ~540 Credits a month over ~238 hours on shift, about half
