//     — place is where the residents sit.
//   minutes (the session), group: { min, max } (more than max joining: the lift is smaller — too crowded)
//   leaders: the staff roles who can lead it (a Lifestyle Coordinator by default)
//   likes: { tags (life-story tags / §7 interests, data/lifeStories.js), personalities } — what makes someone like it;
//     dislikedBy: personalities who would rather not; prefKey: a routine preference that still counts (Cards: the M2
//     'cards' preference)
//   lifts: the outcomes it lifts when a resident who likes it joins (Mood, Social Connection, Independence); drops: the
//     needs it eases (as the M2 Cards step did)
//   quiet: a calm, small-group activity (the SO08 Quiet Interest Plan prefers these)
//   prop: the activity prop drawn in the room while it runs (assets/images/props; null: it uses the room as it is)
//   schedulable: false for the ones that are not put on the timetable (the outing hook, birthdays)
