// Where and how CAREWORKS saves (Milestone 0, bible §3.5.9). Its own database, so it never meets another series
// game's saves. Four campaign slots on core/CampaignSlots (keys campaign_1 … campaign_4, each its own rolling
// SaveSlot, plus a small summary record per slot that the slot screen reads without loading the campaign). The
// account store (Memory Book, achievements, tokens … later) is its own key, never touched by a slot overwrite/delete.
