// Milestone 7: short staffing costs money (bible §14 "understaffing does not become a cheap-profit strategy", §27 agency
// cover is a cost line). Both post to the ledger as they happen: an agency fee when the worker is hired for a shift, and
// care recovery at the end of each day for that day's missed essential tasks (a placeholder for the extra care, reviews
// and family follow-up a missed wake-up, meal, medicine round or settle brings; Milestone 22 tunes it).
//
// The design rule, checked here and by tests/careworks/m7.test.mjs (a 28-day run with one shift short costs more than
// the fully staffed run):
//   leaving one shift empty saves at most one salary: 560 Credits a month (the dearest Standard staff member)
//   an empty shift brings an agency worker every day: 28 × 120 = 3,360 Credits a month — six times the wage saved
//   when the ledger can't pay agency, the unsafe shift's missed essential tasks cost 35 each: one or two a day is
//   980–1,960 Credits a month, and the unsafe-shift counter goes up (quality scores read it in Milestone 26)
// So the cheapest safe roster always beats running short.
// Milestone 10 fix: a small home's nurse on call (bible §14 "RN or on-call"). A brand-new home (Arthur and the three-
// person opening team) must not bleed agency fees the player never chose. The roster's "nurse on call" switch, one per
// shift that allows it (data/shifts.js clinical.onCall), stands in for an RN on shift — and adds coverPoints of Safe
// Coverage — while the home is small and nobody on it needs much clinical care:
//   clinicalNeedAbove   a resident whose assessed Clinical/Nursing need (their profile, data/residents.js) is above this
//                       needs a real RN on every shift (Clinical Support and High Care are 55; everyone else 36 or less)
//   maxResidents        per shift: the switch only covers while the home has at most this many residents (Afternoon:
//                       the card's 4; Night: no limit — the coverPoints then run out for a bigger home by themselves)
//   coverPoints         Safe Coverage Points the nurse on call is worth: 4 low-support residents at Night need 0.4 ×
//                       (1+2+2+2) = 2.8, so Night is covered for them; a bigger or needier home is not, and must staff
//                       it (or pay agency) — the M7 rule that under-staffing never saves money still holds there

// at 5× that is under half an hour. speedMultiplier multiplies data/home.js PERSON.speed (staff) and RESIDENT.speed
// (residents); the hop length (MOTION.stride) is multiplied too, so people take the same number of hops a second on
// screen as before — a longer, brisker hop, never frantic legs or a slide.
