// The home's world (Milestones 1–6): the hidden grid with its inside walls, the placed rooms and facilities, the game
// clock (core/Clock on data/routine.js DAY), the residents living their daily routine, and (Milestone 3) the opening
// team on the Morning shift: they stand their posts and rest at the Staff Room off shift. Milestone 4: each band every
// resident's care plan, routine and needs make care tasks (src/systems/careTasks.js); free staff on shift pick their
// next task themselves by the bible §15 score, walk to the resident (or their room), spend the task's minutes there and
// finish it; a need over the bell line rings that resident's call bell. A routine step with a helper happens when the
// help is done. Milestone 5: the Dining Room (meals) and the Staff Room (off-shift rest), the props block their tiles,
// and each midnight 'care:dayEnd' says how the day went ({ day, done, missed }).
// Milestone 6: up to four residents, one to a Standard Room, each with their own seat at the Dining Room and the
// lounge (their room's number) and their own helpers' spots; the applicant board (src/systems/admissions.js) ticks each
// day; admit() gives a free room, walks them in from the entrance and they join the routine and the task planning from
// the next band; the ledger (src/systems/ledger.js) closes each month (fees and funding in, wages out).
// Milestone 7: three shifts (src/systems/roster.js) with floats, a wing and the Night on-call flag; Safe Coverage Points
// and the four-step fallback (src/systems/coverage.js) tick before the staff move: a warning the band before a short
// shift, float cover, agency workers (hired here: they walk in from the entrance for one shift and leave after), then
// admissions pause and the Cards activity is skipped. Missed essential tasks cost care recovery at the end of each day.
// Milestone 8: all 48 plan options with eligibility (world.eligibility / planCtx), option preferences (a disliked
// option costs a little Mood when chosen; a refused one's tasks are refused and logged as they come up), the plan
// review / stale flag (world.stalePlans, world.reviewPlan) and a new resident's first plan from their primary support.
// Milestone 10: the home's layout is live (src/systems/homeLayout.js on core/FacilitySystem): rooms and facilities
// can be placed, moved and sold in Build Mode (world.build), each piece's seats, posts and walls move with it, and the
// home can grow to Stage 2. After any change the grid is rebuilt, people standing where a piece now stands step to
// the nearest open tile, residents in a moved room move with it, and everyone walking finds a new way. Admissions give
// a free room of the right kind (Memory Support / High-Care residents need theirs) up to the stage's capacity.
// Milestone 15: nutrition and dining (src/systems/dining.js): each meal is a service — the kitchen prepares it (a prep
// task at the Kitchen for a Hospitality worker), servers bring the dining trolley and serve the residents at their seats
// in turn, and anyone who can't come has a tray brought to their room; drinks rounds morning and afternoon; each meal's
// quality, each resident's diet match, favourite dish and dining satisfaction (Mood and the Nutrition need).
// Milestone 16: mobility and rehab (src/systems/mobility.js): each resident's own mobility level and aid (walking speed
// follows it), MO04 two-person transfers, a daily therapy step and four rehab goals for anyone in rehab, the stored
// falls-risk number, and a successful discharge (ready to go home → confirmed, or after three days) with its rewards.
// Milestone 17: memory support (src/systems/memory.js): a steadier routine (continuity counts double, no reseating, a
// routine-change counter → steady / unsettled), life-story sessions (one-to-one, offered on an unsettled day; and
// "Life-story time" on the timetable), stimulation by place (a calm spot for the morning rest), walks — on a safe walking
// path marked in Build Mode, or along the corridor with a gentle walk back — and the stored Choice signal and family
// connection. No cure mechanic: nothing lowers the Memory need.
// Milestone 19: family trust (src/systems/family.js): each resident's family record (a fictional contact, the visit
// pattern, Family Trust and every change with its reason), visitors who walk in and sit with the resident (in the
// Family Room when there is one) and notice how things are, care-plan meetings (the Founder or a nurse attends for an
// hour), compliments, complaints as improvement tasks with an evidence trail (never Credits or a score), and family
// requests (a room move, a birthday party). world.family is the API; visitors are world.visitors (not world.people).
// Milestone 20: specialist programs (src/systems/programs.js, data/programs.js): ten programs the player starts from
// Develop → Programs when their unlock rules pass and their staff hours are free on the roster; each runs its sessions
// (a timetable slot on set days) or one-to-one offers, costs Credits each week (a ledger line) and adds a small effect
// on an outcome an earlier milestone built. A program only offers: residents join or decline by the M14 choice rules,
// and a refused option (or group activities) is never overridden. world.programs is the API.
// Milestone 21: research (src/systems/research.js on core/ResearchSystem, data/research.js): 36 nodes in six branches,
// paid for up front in Research Points (a second currency on the ledger) and finished after a few days in the one slot
// (a second with the Staff Education Centre). Done nodes open programs and facilities and add small boosts here (rb):
// task types, round safety, alert actions, falls risk, rehab, memory sessions, Familiar Care, activities, meals, Energy,
// family meetings and Trust. RP comes only from good care: discharges, compliments, a good month, running programs,
// the learning facilities. world.research is the API.
// Milestone 22: the economy (src/systems/economy.js, data/economy.js): each resident's Support Level from their assessed
// needs (funding and the required care cost by level, Safe Coverage by level), fees by room, respite funding, supplies,
// equipment wear, upkeep of every placed piece and utilities by floor area at the month's close; program funding;
// Care Tokens for firsts; debt recovery (Emergency Credit, a Rescue Investor; admissions pause in deep debt); a family
// may move a resident elsewhere after a week of very low Mood (lost fees). world.economy is the API.
// Milestone 23: community partners and grants (src/systems/partners.js, data/partners.js): partner deals in slots by
// Rank, each with a perk (pp: cost savings posted as their own ledger lines, meal quality, family Trust, garden and
// community activities, training time) and a countable obligation; grants with a countable goal and a deadline. The home
// feeds the counters only with what residents chose to join (a session with a joiner, a pilot session someone said yes
// to). The assistive-tech pilot is offered to everyone here; only those who say yes take part. world.partners is the API.
// Milestone 25: incidents, outbreaks and emergencies (src/systems/incidents.js, data/incidents.js): seven bounded event
// templates whose band (mild / moderate / severe) follows the home's Preparedness; 2–4 responses each (Credits or free; the
// home takes a free one when no choice comes); unwell residents, facilities out of action, staff off sick, extra care
// tasks, an urgent transfer through the M18 alert path; every event ends on its own with an after-report. Falls switch
// on the M16 falls risk (help → the nurse's check → a few days' rest → family told → the plan flagged). Emergency
// supplies (a stock level and a standing order). world.incidents is the API.
// Milestone 26: quality, Rank, accreditations and the peer homes (src/systems/quality.js, data/quality.js,
// data/accreditations.js, data/peers.js): each midnight qualityInputs() hands the quality system one snapshot of what
// really happened (care done, outcomes, Trust, Morale, Preparedness …); the five headline scores are its rolling
// one-month averages; Rank comes from reputation (sustained scores, inspections, accreditations) and opens the gates the
// earlier milestones kept shut until now. world.quality is the API.
// People walk on core/Agent (A* on core/Grid), so they only pass through doorways. No drawing here — the home screen
// draws it — so the Node tests run it as it is.
